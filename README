Currently contains a multitude of scripts from my first ever attempt at analysis
of genetic sequences. Will start documenting and adding the code I have over
time.

Each directory pertains to one step of the computational portion of the
BFG process.



demultiplex_analysis: samples from many different timpoints are pooled before
sequencing to save both time and money. These scripts undo that process from
sequencing reads i.e mapping each read to which sample it came from.

barcode_analysis: now that you have a bunch of reads from different samples,
these scripts turn those strings of letters into actual gene deletions!

complexity_analysis: these scripts let you measure the effectivness of the
sequencing as well as the complexity of your yeast samples.
